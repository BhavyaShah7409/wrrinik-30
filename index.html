                    <p>
                        I've had time to reflect, and I want you to know how deeply sorry I am. I made mistakes that hurt you, and there's no excuse for that. You trusted me with your heart, and I didn't honor that trust the way I should have. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What I'm feeling right now is real and overwhelming. I can see the pain in your eyes, and it breaks me knowing I'm the cause of it. I want to be better—for you, for us, and for myself. Every moment without you feels empty, and all I want is the chance to prove that I've changed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You are extraordinary, kind, and beautiful in every way. You deserve someone who cherishes you completely. I want to be that person. I'm asking for your patience and your forgiveness, but more than that, I'm asking for a chance to show you with my actions that I understand what went wrong and that I'm committed to making things right.
                    </p>
